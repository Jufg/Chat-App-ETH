# Ethereum Chat App

This is the repository for the Ethereum Chat App, a messenger application with decentralised transactions on the
Ethereum network.

The Ethereum Chat App will be developed as a dApp (decentralised application). To make the dApp as user-friendly as
possible, the front-end framework [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) will be used. Currently, the data is stored on
Google [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). The aim of this project is to completely decentralise the application.
Files, user data, chats and transactions are to function and be stored decentralised.

## Documentation

[Here](docs/README.md) you can find the Documentation of the Project. It
contains associated papers, a description of what the application wants to achieve, why this application is needed and
how it works.
