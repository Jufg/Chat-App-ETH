# Etheruem Chat App - Documentation

## Abstract

The world has become a globalised service society in recent years, with payments increasingly being made online by third
parties such as banks and other service providers. Users need to trust that this third party will execute transactions
correctly and that data will be managed correctly so that it is not accessible to the public. Cryptocurrencies offer a
fully decentralised way of executing and storing transactions using blockchain technology, so that there is no need to
trust any third party. With the Ethereum network, it is also possible to program applications on the blockchain. The
following application is designed to provide a decentralised and anonymous way of chatting and sending money to friends
using the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) network and the browser extension [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).
