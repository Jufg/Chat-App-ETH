# Etheruem Chat App - Documentation

## Abstract

The world has become a globalised service society in recent years, with payments increasingly being made online by third
parties such as banks and other service providers. Users need to trust that this third party will execute transactions
correctly and that data will be managed correctly so that it is not accessible to the public. Cryptocurrencies offer a
fully decentralised way of executing and storing transactions using blockchain technology, so that there is no need to
trust any third party. With the Ethereum network, it is also possible to program applications on the blockchain. The
following application is designed to provide a decentralised and anonymous way of chatting and sending money to friends
using the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) network and the browser extension [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

### Introduction

In recent decades, the world has developed into a digital service society in which almost everything is done online.
Also Payments are mostly done on the Internet. This even happens when paying in retail stores with a credit or girocard.
In many places, it is common to pay with a smartphone or smartwatch.

In order to execute a payment, third party service providers are required. These service providers can be banks or
online payment services such as *PayPal* and *Sofort√ºberweisung*. In the case of payment by smartphone or smartwatch,
large companies like *Google* or *Apple* stand in between as intermediaries. The responsibility for the transaction from
one party to another is therefore transferred to a third party, which receives all the information necessary or
available to execute the transaction. This information contains not only data on the accounts between which the money is
to be transferred, but also of the persons to which the accounts can be assigned, and in some cases, the purpose for
which the transaction is to take place. In this way, the third-party knows who the holder of the card or device is, in
which supermarket he spends how much money and in some cases, what he has bought.

Consumers not only need to trust that service providers will execute transactions correctly, it must also be taken into
account that payment data will be shared, for example with advertisers or for credit rating. A completely anonymous way
of transferring money, as it is the case with analogue money, so cash, cannot be guaranteed with our current financial
system for immaterial transactions.

Decentralised cryptocurrencies offer a solution. Decentralised infrastructures allow transactions without a third party
and offer anonymity.

The basis of the present paper is the development of an application that makes it possible to get in touch with other
people, to network and communicate. The linked people can then use the application to make anonymous payments to each
other based on a cryptocurrency.
